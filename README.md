# Rapidfire

_Rapidfire_ is a networked side-on 2D shooter. The objective is to kill the other player before they kill you.

_Rapidfire_ was made in Unity 5.5.1 by Lawson Busch, Sam Hollenbach and David McNichols. 

## Running Rapidfire

To run _Rapidire_, clone this project from GitHub to your desired directory. Open this directory in Unity, and you should see 4 scene files in the Assets folder in the project explorer. Double click the "Start" scene to open it. You should now be able to run the game by either pressing the play button at the top of the Unity client, or pressing Ctrl-B (Command-B on Mac) to build and run a standalone version of the game. 

Once in the game, press the Play button to enter the Lobby scene. Once in the Lobby scene:
-To host a game click "LAN Host(H)", this will take you to the host lobbby. Next, share your IP with the person you want to play (find your IP with [this](http://www.whatsmyip.org/) tool) and wait for them to join.
-To join a game enter the IP of the Host player into the textbox next to "LAN Client(C)", and then click this button to enter the host lobby.

When both players are visible in the lobby, click "Start" to set yourself as Ready. Once both players are Ready, you will enter a _Rapidfire_ match.

## Controls

The main horizontal movement is controlled by the _A_ and _D_ keys (or arrow keys). Either _W_ or _spacebar_ can be used to jump. Use your mouse/trackpad to aim, and click to shoot. You may hold down the mouse click to repeatedly fire. Press _Esc_ to quit the match.
